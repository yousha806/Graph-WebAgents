To find the highest scoring points per game in playoff runs, I need to locate the relevant data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see columns for \"Points\", \"Minutes\", \"Field Goal %\", \"3P %\", \"FT %\", \"Rebounds\", \"Assists\", \"Steals\", \"Blocks\", and \"Points Per Game\". The \"Points Per Game\" column is likely to contain the information needed to determine the highest scoring points per game in playoff runs.\n\nSince the table is visible and the \"Points Per Game\" column is present, I should examine the values in this column to identify the highest score. However, the task requires finding the highest scoring points per game in playoff runs, which might require filtering or specific data points.\n\nGiven the current view, the most logical next step is to scroll down to see if there is more data or if the table contains the necessary information. The table might have more rows or additional context that could help identify the highest scoring points per game in playoff runs.\n\nSCROLL down",

The current design shows \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY PLEASE WELCOME\" which seems to be a birthday-themed design. However, the task specifies \"Happy Birthday\" on it, which might be a specific design. The \"Change\" button is available to modify the design.\n\nStep 3: Personalize the card. There are two text fields: \"This is a gift\" and \"This is for me\". Since the task is for myself, I should select \"This is for me\".\n\nStep 4: Schedule delivery. The task does not specify a delivery schedule, so I can choose \"Send now\" or \"Send later\". \"Send now\" is the default and quickest option.\n\nStep 5: Add to cart. After setting the amount, design, and personalization, the \"Add to cart\" button should be clicked.\n\nHowever, the AXTree does not show the exact text \"Happy Birthday\" in the design preview, so I need to check if the current design is appropriate. Since the task says \"Happy Birthday\" on it, and the current design shows \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY PLEASE WELCOME\", it might be acceptable. If not, I would need to click \"Change\" to select a different design.\n\nGiven the current information, I will proceed with the current design since it appears to be a birthday-themed design.\n\nThe next action is to click the \"Add to cart\" button to add the $100 eGift card to the cart.\n\nCLICK Add to cart",
